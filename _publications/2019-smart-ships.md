excerpt: "Image feature extraction from JSON object; CNN algorithm; Python Tensorflow<br /><br />**Abstract:**In recent years, along with the development of artificial intelligence technologies and related technical products, the
evolution of smart ship has accelerated. Smart ship has become the main development direction of ship industry in the
future. In this paper, we proposed a CNN model to recognize ships in bay and sea area. Data sets of Ships in Satellite
Imagery data and Airbus data were employed for model training and testing and features are pixel data of images and
used in the classification problem. We used labels either “ship” or “no-ship” as our dependant variable to train the
CNN model. Finally we get high accuracy of 98.125% for ship satellite images recognition. Through the performance
metrics, including precision, recall and F1-score, we proved the reliability of this CNN model. Moreover, our CNN model
is able to identify real bay and sea satellite images as well. The results make a great contribution for the development
of smart ship and carve out the possibilities for fully automated operation of ship and ports."

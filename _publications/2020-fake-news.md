## Abstract
This paper proposed a deep learning algorithm system to fulfil fake
news and misinformation detection on COVID-19 related headlines. Long
short-term memory (LSTM), convolutional neural network (CNN) and Deep
belief networks (DBNs) are performed in order to determine the optimal
algorithm. Based on the model performance measures, such as accuracy, AUC
score, and F1 score, this study figures out the optimal models, which are CNN
and LSTM with an accuracy of up to 94%, for the COVID-19 fake news
detection. Finally, this paper provides an algorithm-based ranking method for
mainstream media credibilities. The result indicates that mainstream media
channels in the US are reliable for reporting the COVID-19 related news and
information.

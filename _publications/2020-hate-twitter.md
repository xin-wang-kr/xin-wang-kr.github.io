excerpt: "Pandemic-related-hate; GIS; Sentiment analysis; Anti-Asian Hate tweets; Deep neural network algorithm<br />**Abstract:** Anti-Asian hate tweets caused by COVID-19 pandemic is an
ongoing social problem in the USA and around the world. Although existing
studies have been done by using a text classifier, little is known on how deep
learning works with public sentiments of political opinions and geographical
diversities. This paper provides a new method to classify the pandemic-related
anti-Asian hater on Twitter. A novel dataset for tracking pandemic-related
Twitter users, which contains more than 10 million tweets, is created in this
study. Target users are annotated by identifying their sentiments towards the
US elections with their geolocations. The empirical result indicates that the
political sentiments and the county-level election results make significant
contributions to the model building. By training a DNN model, over 190,000
Twitter users are classified as hate or non-hate with a 61% accuracy and a 0.63
AUC score."

Welcome! I am a third-year Ph.D. in Binghamton University (BU). My research focuses on human-centered AI, representation learning, machine learning, computational social science, and conversational AI. I am a member of the [Complex Adaptive Systems & Computational Intelligence Lab](https://casci.binghamton.edu/casci.php) held by [Dr. Luis M. Rocha](https://casci.binghamton.edu/) at BU. 

My PhD study is on __Trust Dynamics in Human-AI Communication__. My study goal is to capture and model trust dynamics and to improve trust-aware adaption in conversational AI. Three mentors support my study from different displines: [Dr. Sadamori Kojaku](https://skojaku.github.io/) (machine learning and data visualization) at BU, [Dr. William Hayes](https://www.binghamton.edu/psychology/people/profile.html?id=whayes2) (computational cognitive modeling) at BU, and [Dr. Min Sun Kim](https://sci.manoa.hawaii.edu/min-sun-kim/) (communication and social influence) at University of Hawaii at Manoa. My study is funded by Multidisciplinary Summer Research Grant from the Center for Cognitive Applications, BU.

During my PhD, as a main developer, I also contribute to __Community Energy Compass - Data-driven Visualization Toolkit Development.__ (Under the supervision with [Dr. Neha Patankar](https://patankarneha.wixsite.com/home) and collaborating with [Zero Lab](https://zero.lab.princeton.edu/) held by [Dr. Jesse Jenkins](https://environmenthalfcentury.princeton.edu/experts/jesse-jenkins) at Princeton University.) 

<!---
Before that, I was a COVID-19 research team leader in the [BIG DATA & AI Lab](https://intelrabbit.com/research-projects/) at [IntelligentRabbit LLC](https://intelrabbit.com/services/). Besides, I was a machine learning engineer at Tianjin Value Fair Technology Inc in China for NLP-based financial application development for public company annual reports in 2017. I have earned my master's degree in Data Science in 2018 and a bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering at Aeronautical Engineering direction in 2014. I am also a Data Science volunteer at [DataKind Global](https://www.datakind.org/), having served [Goolge AI Impact Challenge](https://impactchallenge.withgoogle.com/techforsocialgood) in 2019 and [data.org Growth and Recovery Challenge for COVID-19](https://data.org/initiatives/challenge/) in 2020.
In 2016, I achieved a certification from Google Developer StudyJams on Android mobile app in Java.

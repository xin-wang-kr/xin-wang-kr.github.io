Welcome! I am currently pursuing Ph.D. study. Before that, I was a COVID-19 research team leader in the [BIG DATA & AI Lab](https://intelrabbit.com/research-projects/) at [IntelligentRabbit LLC](https://intelrabbit.com/services/). Besides, I was a machine learning engineer at Tianjin Value Fair Technology Inc in China for NLP-based financial application development for public company annual reports in 2017. I have earned my master's degree in Data Science in 2018 and a bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering at Aeronautical Engineering direction in 2014. I am also a Data Science volunteer at [DataKind Global](https://www.datakind.org/), having served [Goolge AI Impact Challenge](https://impactchallenge.withgoogle.com/techforsocialgood) in 2019 and [data.org Growth and Recovery Challenge for COVID-19](https://data.org/initiatives/challenge/) in 2020.
In 2016, I achieved a certification from Google Developer StudyJams on Android mobile app in Java.

My research works have been [published](publications) in
*International Journal of Society Systems Science*, *International Journal of Data Science* (**Elsevier index**),
*International Journal of Operations Research and Information Systems*,
*International Journal of Decision Science*,
*International Journal of Data Analysis and Information Systems* and *IGI Global*. 
I had done [research](research) on fake news and misinformation detection, anti-Asian hater profile and geographical 
analysis, anti-Asian hate indicator establishment, smart ship, the relationship between Bitcoin and stock market,
AI music generation, image diagnosis on skin cancer, region-based bird call recognition, face mask detection, and etc. 

<ins>**Recently**</ins>, I am conducting two studies. One is on COVID-19 vaccine confidence analysis in a global scale through textual and visual sentiments detected from the user-generated contents on Instagram. The other is to predict human biomarkers, such as heart rate, through generating emotional features on tweets and applying wearable technology.

I have [taught](teaching) courses in Mobile App Development and Python Programming in AI at BIG DATA & AI Lab at IntelligentRabbit LLC.
As an Instructor at [GEC academy](https://www.gecacademy.com/), I have taught Academic Writing course for [AI HUB](https://www.gecacademy.com/ai-hub) and Intro to Java course for general class in undergraduate and graduate levels.

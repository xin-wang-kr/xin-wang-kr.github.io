Welcome! I am a third-year Ph.D. in Systems Science at Binghamton University (BU). My research interest focuses on Human-AI Interaction, Computational Interaction, Conversational AI, Cognitive Modeling, Natural Language Processing, Information Visualization, Computational Social Science. I also serve as steering committee member for __ACM Conference on Conversational User Interfaces__ (2025-2030). 


<!---
I am a member of the [Complex Adaptive Systems & Computational Intelligence Lab](https://casci.binghamton.edu/casci.php) held by [Dr. Luis M. Rocha](https://casci.binghamton.edu/) at BU. 


Three mentors support my study from different displines: [Dr. Sadamori Kojaku](https://skojaku.github.io/) (machine learning and data visualization) at BU, [Dr. William Hayes](https://www.binghamton.edu/psychology/people/profile.html?id=whayes2) (computational cognitive modeling) at BU, and [Dr. Min Sun Kim](https://sci.manoa.hawaii.edu/min-sun-kim/) (communication and social influence) at University of Hawaii at Manoa.

I am interested in understanding psychological and cognitive states as reflected in human language interaction. Specially, my PhD study focuses on __Trust Dynamics in Human-AI Communication__. My study goals is to advance trustworthy, adaptive AI system by __(1) capturing, visualizing and modeling trust dynamics__, and __(2) developing real-time trust-adaptive conversational agents in individual and group settings__. My study is funded by __Multidisciplinary Summer Research Grant__ from [the Center for Cognitive Applications, BU](https://www.binghamton.edu/psychology/graduate/cognitive-brain-sciences/caps.html) and __Professor Jim Geer Summer Scholarship__ launched by [Dr. Nana Banerjee](https://www.binghamton.edu/news/story/5008/weather-man-alumnus-leads-company-using-ai-for-better-forecasting-and-more). My study on trust has been highlighted on [Communications of the ACM](https://cacm.acm.org/news/ais-capture-trust-cues/), [The Science Archive](https://thesciencearchive.org/2503-07279v1/), [TechXplore](https://techxplore.com/news/2025-05-chatbots-tool-easier-gauge.html) and [BingUNews](https://www.binghamton.edu/news/story/5570/how-much-do-we-trust-chatbots-new-tool-from-binghamton-university-makes-it-easier-to-gauge).

In Summer 2023, I was summer research intern at [the Research Foundation at SUNY](https://www.rfsuny.org/) and contributed to __Community Energy Compass - Data-driven Visualization Toolkit Development__ (Under the supervision with [Dr. Neha Patankar](https://patankarneha.wixsite.com/home) and collaborating with [Zero Lab](https://zero.lab.princeton.edu/) held by [Dr. Jesse Jenkins](https://environmenthalfcentury.princeton.edu/experts/jesse-jenkins) at Princeton University). 

<!---
Before that, I was a COVID-19 research team leader in the [BIG DATA & AI Lab](https://intelrabbit.com/research-projects/) at [IntelligentRabbit LLC](https://intelrabbit.com/services/). Besides, I was a machine learning engineer at Tianjin Value Fair Technology Inc in China for NLP-based financial application development for public company annual reports in 2017. I have earned my master's degree in Data Science in 2018 and a bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering at Aeronautical Engineering direction in 2014. I am also a Data Science volunteer at [DataKind Global](https://www.datakind.org/), having served [Goolge AI Impact Challenge](https://impactchallenge.withgoogle.com/techforsocialgood) in 2019 and [data.org Growth and Recovery Challenge for COVID-19](https://data.org/initiatives/challenge/) in 2020.
In 2016, I achieved a certification from Google Developer StudyJams on Android mobile app in Java.

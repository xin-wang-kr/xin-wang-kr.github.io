Welcome! I am a COVID-19 research team leader in the
[BIG DATA & AI Lab](https://intelrabbit.com/research-projects/) 
at [IntelligentRabbit LLC](https://intelrabbit.com/services/). Before that, I was a machine
learning engineer at 
[Tianjin Value Fair Technology Inc](http://www.valuefair.cn/) in China. I earned my master 
in Data Science in 2018 and a bachelor in Industrial Engineering at Aeronautical Engineering direction in 2014. 
I am also a Data Science volunteer at [DataKind Global](https://www.datakind.org/), 
having served Goolge AI Impact Challenge and data.org Challenge in 2019 and 2020.


My work has been [published](publications) or is forthcoming in
*International Journal of Society Systems Science*, *International Journal of Data Science*,
*International Journal of Operations Research and Information Systems*,
*International Journal of Decision Science*,
*International Journal of Data Analysis and Information Systems* and *IGI Global*. 
I had [researches](research) on Fake News and Misinformation detection, Anti-Asian hater profile and geographical 
analysis, Anti-Asian hate indicator establishment, smart ship, and the relationship between Bitcoin and stock market. 
I have [taught](teaching) courses in Mobile App Development, Python Programming in AI and Academic Writing. 

I am a co-author for a book called [*Applied Big Data Analytics and Its Role in COVID-19*](https://www.igi-global.com/book/applied-big-data-analytics-its/273493), 
which introduces the most recently industrial applications and research topics on COVID-19 with big data analytics. 
Featuring coverage on a broad range of big data technologies such as data collection, data cleaning, 
data visualization, deep learning, predictive analysis, natural language processing, 
geographic information system, social media analysis, image recognition, voice recognition, 
and motion recognition, this publication provides concrete examples and cases of usages of data-driven 
projects in COVID-19 as well as the challenges and opportunities of generation value from big data.

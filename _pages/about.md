Welcome! I am currently a Ph.D. student in Systems Science at the State University of New York at Binghamton. 
Before joining the Ph.D. program, I was a COVID-19 research team leader in the
[BIG DATA & AI Lab](https://intelrabbit.com/research-projects/) 
at [IntelligentRabbit LLC](https://intelrabbit.com/services/). Besides, I was a machine
learning engineer at Tianjin Value Fair Technology Inc in China in 2017, working for . I earned my master 
in Data Science in 2018 and a bachelor in Industrial Engineering at Aeronautical Engineering direction in 2014. 
I am also a Data Science volunteer at [DataKind Global](https://www.datakind.org/), 
having served Goolge AI Impact Challenge in 2019 and data.org Growth and Recovery Challenge for COVID-19 in 2020.
In 2016, I achieved a certification from Google Developer StudyJams on Android mobile app in Java.

My research works have been [published](publications) in
*International Journal of Society Systems Science*, *International Journal of Data Science* (**Elsevier index**),
*International Journal of Operations Research and Information Systems*,
*International Journal of Decision Science*,
*International Journal of Data Analysis and Information Systems* and *IGI Global*. 
I had [researches](research) on Fake News and Misinformation detection, Anti-Asian hater profile and geographical 
analysis, Anti-Asian hate indicator establishment, smart ship, the relationship between Bitcoin and stock market,
AI music generation, image diagnosis on skin cancer, region-based bird call recognition, face mask detection, and etc. 

Recently, I am conducting two researches. One is on COVID-19 vaccine confidence analysis through textual and visual sentiments detected from
user-generated contents on Instagram. The other is to predict human biomarkers, such as heart rate, through emotional features on tweets.

I have [taught](teaching) courses in Mobile App Development and Python Programming in AI at BIG DATA & AI Lab at IntelligentRabbit LLC.
As an Instructor at [GEC academy](https://www.gecacademy.com/), I have taught Academic Writing course for [AI HUB](https://www.gecacademy.com/ai-hub) and Intro to Java course for general class in undergraduate and graduate levels.

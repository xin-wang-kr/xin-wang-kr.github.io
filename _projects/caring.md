Despite a large body of evidence that nursing quality is directly related to patient outcomes in the acute care setting, nurses often lack timely information to use in improving individual patient outcomes, and indices of outcomes across patient populations are slow to budge over time. Our goal is to develop Chart-assessment for Real-time Investigation of Nursing and Guidance (CARING), an automated machine learning system to report and predict nursing quality indicators in real-time for hospitalized patients to assist nurses in care planning. Outcomes of this project will give nurses actionable data in real time to improve nursing care quality that they do not receive now.

This is an ongoing collaboration with [Vicki Hertzberg](https://www.nursing.emory.edu/faculty-staff/vicki-stover-hertzberg) and [Roy Simpson](https://www.nursing.emory.edu/faculty-staff/roy-l-simpson).
The project is supported by the National Institute of Health (NIH) under award number 5R01LM013323.
